              <p>
                The catalyst for my creative career was watching my grandpa
                running around his backyard with a yard waste bag over his head
                while I gleefully dodged him, and the wickets he had stuck in
                the ground. He was an expert at playing - the type of play where
                the rules are fluid and no one is quite sure who is winning, but
                it’s probably everyone. Watching my grandpa play was a
                masterclass in the creative act and has guided me in my own
                creative process: starting with a spark of fun, pulling that
                thread, and adding layers until something beautiful and
                interesting comes of it. This is reflected in my undergraduate
                thesis piece, “I Can’t Focus When You’re Watching Me” for the
                New Media program at Toronto Metropolitan University. I started
                with the tool — a drawing plotter, something I was excited to
                play with. From there, I discovered its strengths and quirks to
                see what I could create with it. Through this process of play, I
                grew to love the machine’s method of drawing, laboriously
                tracing lines that would take a laser printer only an instant.
                This became the basis of the finished piece, a nervous drawing
                machine that reacts to being observed by scribbling over its own
                work. I was initially attracted to the Future Sketches group
                because it values and supports this method of creation. It seems
                like a place that would support me in making discoveries about
                my own interests and in turn uncovering delightful ideas that
                might get buried under the rigidity of traditional research and
                development.
                <br /><br />
                After attending the Future Sketches information session and
                hearing about the collaboration that happens in the group, I
                found myself drawn to the atmosphere of the Media Lab as a
                whole. In my undergraduate degree, I was part of a small New
                Media program whose greatest facility wasn’t the fancy
                fabrication lab, but the makerspace – a room with tables and
                chairs, and a 3D printer that never worked properly, but it was
                alive and electrifying! It was a place where a friend usually
                had the exact solution for your problem that led to a
                breakthrough, where inspiration was derived from the coexistence
                of others in a creative working space. Unfortunately, this space
                was restricted for the final year and a half of my time in the
                program. The realities of COVID-19 resulted in the University
                mandating a year's worth of independent exploration. I want to
                experience the joys of parallel work and play again, and I think
                Future Sketches is a place where I could find that. The resource
                at MIT that is most exciting to me is the people, and the Future
                Sketches group fosters a space for wonderful people who have
                playful and creative ideas.
                <br /><br />
                Currently, I am interested in removing barriers to the creative
                process when working with technologies external to a computer.
                Adapting software and code to interface with the real world has
                been the largest barrier that I’ve encountered, and I have
                benefited greatly from the hard work of generous strangers
                online to overcome them. One tool I’d like to build is for LED
                pixel mapping onto 3D objects. This process when done solely in
                an Arduino IDE can be complex and inaccessible since designing
                light patterns for unusual surfaces can be difficult to create
                without vizualization. I’m interested in developing a tool that
                projects video content and generative patterns onto a virtual
                representation of a 3D object. This in turn, translates in real
                time to the physical object. I’ve accomplished a multi-step
                process of doing this in Touchdesigner for a project involving a
                glowing, interactive model of a brain with an internal hub of
                LEDs. A more intuitive, live updating tool could eliminate the
                barrier between ideas and reality.
                <br /><br />
                The second tool that I’d be excited to create is one to help
                interface with obsolete pen plotters and dot matrix printers
                from the 80s. I love these old machines, partly because of the
                iconic noises that they make, but mostly because they are
                relatively simple to understand and have the potential to be
                used in an educational context. Engaging with past technologies
                has an element of whimsy to it! Unlike the sterility of modern
                technology, which can be daunting, there is character to these
                older machines. They are beautifully simple and endlessly fun. I
                think that one of the reasons 3D printers are so popular in
                Maker education is because just by watching them, you can start
                to understand how they work and what might be required to
                control them. However, the communication protocols used in old
                pen plotters are antiquated and difficult to translate. I would
                love to design tools (libraries and/or physical adapters) that
                would allow something like an Arduino to easily interface with a
                wide range of old tech in a similar way that the FastLED library
                brings easy functionality to a wide range of LED chips. The
                community of makers and hackers who repurpose these old machines
                is small. Everyone has their own process of reviving them and I
                would be excited to contribute to the effort to modernize
                beautiful and useful old tools.
                <br /><br />
                Engaging with technology in a fun and untethered environment is
                the best way to imagine possibilities that may otherwise be
                stuck behind a wall of troubleshooting and debugging. The
                projects I have in mind could smooth out some common speed bumps
                that I’ve encountered within my creative process, and make it
                easier for others to find a more direct path from idea to
                reality.
